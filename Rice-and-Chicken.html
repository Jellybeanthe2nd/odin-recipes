<h3>Delicious and high protein rice and chicken</h3>
<p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong> 1 1/4 pounds </strong> pounds boneless, skinless chicken breast (4 small or 2 large cut in half lengthwise for thinner pieces)</li>
        <li><strong>1 tablespoon </strong> tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li><strong>1 can  </strong>(10 1/2 ounces) Campbell’s® Condensed Cream of Chicken Soup or 98% Fat Free Cream of Chicken Soup or Unsalted Cream of Chicken Soup</li>
        <li><strong>1 1/2 cups </strong>water</li>
        <li><strong>1/4 </strong> garlic powder</li>
        <li><strong>2 cups  teaspoon</strong>paprika</li>

        <li><strong>2 cups</strong> uncooked instant white rice (for creamier rice, decrease to 1 1/2 cups)</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Instructions
</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the chicken with salt and pepper.  Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the chicken and cook for 6 minutes or until browned on both sides (to prevent sticking- make sure the skillet and oil are hot before adding the chicken).  Remove the chicken from the skillet.
        </li>

        <li>Stir the soup, water and paprika in the skillet and heat to a boil.  Stir in the rice and broccoli.  Reduce the heat to low.  Return the chicken to the skillet.  Sprinkle the chicken with additional paprika.  Cover and cook for 5 minutes or until the chicken is done and the rice is tender.  Season to taste before serving.</li>
